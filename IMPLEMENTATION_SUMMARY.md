# Analyze & Earn Feature Upgrade - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully upgraded the 'Analyze & Earn' feature to support photo and video submissions with a complete refactoring of both frontend UI and backend video processing capabilities.

## Part 1: Front-End (React/JavaScript) Refactoring ‚úÖ

### Three Input Options Implemented:
1. **üì∏ Upload Photo** - Standard file input for images (`type="file" accept="image/*" name="photo_file"`)
2. **üñºÔ∏è Select Video from Gallery** - Standard file input for videos (`type="file" accept="video/*" name="video_gallery_file"`)
3. **üé• Record Video & Upload** - Mobile-only camera recording (`type="file" accept="video/*" capture="environment" name="video_camera_file"`)

### Mobile Detection Logic:
- Implemented JavaScript mobile device detection using user agent and touch capabilities
- Video camera option is conditionally hidden on desktop/non-mobile platforms
- Responsive UI that adapts to different screen sizes

### UI Features:
- Dynamic input type selection with visual feedback
- Separate file upload areas for each input type
- Video preview with controls for uploaded videos
- Updated results display to handle both image and video analysis

## Part 2: Server-Side Video Processing ‚úÖ

### Keyframe Extraction Algorithm:
Implemented the exact 5-frame extraction algorithm as specified:

1. **F1 (0.5s)** - Initial State/Item View
2. **F5 (2.5s)** - Final State/Disposal Result  
3. **F3** - Action frame (largest frame-to-frame change between 0.5s and 2.5s)
4. **F2** - 0.5s before F3 (Pre-Action Context)
5. **F4** - 0.5s after F3 (Post-Action Context)

### Technical Implementation:
- Uses OpenCV for video processing and frame analysis
- Temporary file handling for video processing
- Frame difference analysis to identify action moments
- Robust error handling and cleanup

## Part 3: Multi-Modal Gemini API Integration ‚úÖ

### Video Analysis Function:
- Sends all 5 extracted frames to Gemini API in a single request
- Uses the exact prompt specified for disposal verification
- Returns structured JSON with waste type and disposal verification status

### API Endpoint Updates:
- Updated `/api/detect` endpoint to handle both images and videos
- Updated `/api/analyze-detailed` endpoint for comprehensive analysis
- Proper file field routing based on input type
- Duplicate detection for both images and videos

## Key Features Implemented:

### Frontend:
- ‚úÖ Three distinct input options with proper file types
- ‚úÖ Mobile device detection and conditional UI
- ‚úÖ Video preview with controls
- ‚úÖ Dynamic results display for both images and videos
- ‚úÖ Responsive design for all screen sizes

### Backend:
- ‚úÖ 5-frame keyframe extraction algorithm
- ‚úÖ Video processing with OpenCV and MoviePy
- ‚úÖ Multi-modal Gemini API integration
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling and cleanup
- ‚úÖ Duplicate detection for videos
- ‚úÖ Points awarding for verified disposal

### API Integration:
- ‚úÖ Exact prompt implementation for video analysis
- ‚úÖ JSON response parsing and validation
- ‚úÖ Fallback handling for API failures
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error messages

## Dependencies Added:
- `moviepy==1.0.3` - For video processing capabilities

## File Changes:
1. **frontend/src/components/EarnPoints.jsx** - Complete UI refactoring
2. **backend/app.py** - Video processing and multi-modal API integration
3. **backend/requirements.txt** - Added moviepy dependency

## Testing Recommendations:
1. Test photo upload functionality (existing)
2. Test video gallery selection
3. Test mobile video recording (requires mobile device)
4. Test keyframe extraction with various video lengths
5. Test disposal verification with different waste types
6. Test error handling for invalid videos

## Notes:
- The `capture="environment"` attribute ensures rear camera usage on mobile
- Video processing handles videos of varying lengths (minimum 3 seconds recommended)
- All temporary files are properly cleaned up after processing
- The system maintains backward compatibility with existing photo functionality
